    <title>My First Web Page using html</title>

    <h1>Herein i used (h1) to mae my largest,boldest heading</h1>
    <p>This one uses (p) and contains normal text</p>
    <h2>The headings go from (h1) to (h6). This is obviously (h2)</h2>
    <p><strong>I can use (p) again and again. I can also use (strong) 
    to make certain words bold. Like this one.
    <p>Inline elements do not start a new line and take only necessary width
        But block elements start a new line and take full width.
        Inline tags are (span), (img),(s) etc.
        Block tags are (div),(p),(h1),(form) etc.
        <em> This one tag called (em) is used to italicize the line</em>
    </p>
    <p>If i use an (a href="") tag it will open a link on the given text. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&t=28s">
        Like this one
    </a>
    But if i want to open the link in a new tab i will have to use (target="_blank") attribute. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&t=28s" target="_blank">
